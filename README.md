# Hello there! I'm Kirill 👋🏻
Currently I am a [TUM](https://www.tum.de/) Student 👨‍🎓 at Mathematics in Data Science program. 

Last year I was an NLP engineer at [Eva AI](https://www.evaapp.ai/). Our team is creating a virtual friend for all kind of purposes. Most of the time here I am working on **creating long-term memory for our chat bot**:
- Creating a model for generating questions on previous day dialog 🐱
- Replacing rule-based classification with a distilled and quantized BERT-like models 🪄
- Using T5 for summarization and conditional question generation 👀


Previously I was creating👨‍💼 a Pytorch-based DL framework AutoNER. Alongside was the research👨‍🔬 of Active and Meta Learning ([my blogpost📜](https://habr.com/ru/company/sberbank/blog/649609/) on habr).

In 2021 I graduated👨‍🎓 from [BCs Applied Mathematics and Informatics](https://cs.hse.ru/en/) and now I'm happy to share my experience [leading practical lessons at DL course](https://github.com/Kirili4ik/iad-deep-learning) at the faculty of CS.

In my spare time, I like learning something new about DL and spreading the knowledge to others. For more information, please check my [pinned projects](https://github.com/kirili4ik#-projects), [presentations](https://github.com/Kirili4ik/pres-n-articles) or [CV](https://github.com/Kirili4ik/pres-n-articles/blob/master/CV_Kirill_Gelvan.pdf) 🤗
	
**Field of interests**: NLP, DL for Audio, Generative Models

### 🛠️ Skills 
- **Programming**: &emsp;Python, SQL, C++
- **ML/DL**:  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  PyTorch, NumPy, SciPy, pandas, scikit-learn
- **Applications**:&emsp;&nbsp; git, bash, Docker
